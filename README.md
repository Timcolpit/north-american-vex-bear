A public repo for team 2158D the ausTIN CANs' VEX Robotics code! We are from Anderson HS in Austin, Texas. We post our drive/auto/other code on here, so that other teams or individuals can read over it, get inspiration, and provide us tips if you so wish. Thanks, and best of luck out there in VEX Skyrise! :D
